## How do I use this?

This script deletes everything on your phone, including the main OS. Make sure to backup all of your data before using this script as **anything on the device prior to running this script will be UNRECOVERABLE afterwards**. Use this script at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damages caused by you using this script.

To use this app, you need to downgrade to a supported version, and have a supported device.

`xcode-select install` to install `git` on macos

`git clone https://github.com/y08wilm/Semaphorin && cd Semaphorin`

## Support

We now have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WQWDBBYJTb) where you can get help with this project.

If, for whatever reason, that invite link does not work, please contact [wilm271](https://t.me/wilm271) on Telegram.

The Discord server is strictly for Semaphorin support only. Please don't bring personal issues into our server.

## First run

Connect device in DFU mode

`sudo ./semaphorin.sh <the version you are downgrading to> --restore`

For example you may write `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 7.1.2 --restore`

The script has to backup important files from your current iOS version before you can downgrade.

When the script asks `[*] Please enter the iOS version that is currently installed on your device.`, type your current iOS version and then hit the Enter key to continue.

It should then begin the process of downgrading your device. Please follow the on screen instructions. This might take a while. Your device will reboot multiple times.

Your device will be jailbroken automatically.

If you are on iOS 7 please hit "go" in the wtfis app on your home screen to patch sandbox to allow Cydia Substrate (tweak injection) to work properly.

## Subsequent runs after downgrade is finished

Connect device in DFU mode

`sudo ./semaphorin.sh <the version you downgraded to previously> --boot`

For example, if you downgraded to iOS 7.1.2, you would run `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 7.1.2 --boot`.

It should just boot to your requested iOS version normally.

## Setup.app bypass

We will not be providing any support for any method of deleting `/Applications/Setup.app` with our script.

This is only to comply with [r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/) and [r/LegacyJailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/) rules and guidelines.

The script will downgrade your iOS version and jailbreak the downgraded OS very easily, but will not allow for bypassing **any** sort of Activation Lock.

## Troubleshooting

   ### Deep sleep, device won't turn on after locking it, have to reboot.
   The issue that causes deep sleep is unfortunately **unfixable**. There is, however, a workaround to this:
      
      1. Add [this repo](julioverne.github.io) to Cydia after setup
      
      2. Search for the tweak Fiona
      
      3. Install it
      
      4. Profit
      
   *Note: This does slightly affect battery life due to the way it works. You probably aren't using this script for battery life though, are you.

   ### Unsupported OS
   The script only officially works on macOS 10.13 up to 10.15 (High Sierra to Catalina) due to some limitations on the developer's end. You have to install one of those versions to use the script. Please do not ask us about this.

Linux support is not planned either, do not ask about this either.

   ### Unable to connect to WiFi networks, incorrect password.
   This is caused by an issue that's *impossible* to fix. You need to connect to an open WiFi network

   You can create one using the Internet Sharing feature on macOS or [linux-wifi-hotspot](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot) on, you guessed it, Linux if you prefer using another computer for this. 

   Be careful when doing this since *anyone* can connect to the open network you created. We are not responsible for **any** damages caused by doing this.

   ### No apps on the Home Screen (iOS 8.0)
   This is a weird issue with iOS 8. The workaround is easy, however.

   After you unlock your device for the first time post setup, there will be no apps on the Home Screen. The workaround is, once you're on the Home Screen, to open the Control Center (swipe up) and press the Calculator icon. Once open, you can exit out of Calculator. This should make all icons appear.

   ### Cydia is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Cydia, enter `cydia://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter.  

   ### Respring not working through Cydia and co. (iOS 7.0.x)
   Hit "go" inside the wtfis app on your home screen. This will properly respring your device.   
   This means you will have to quit out of Cydia after installing a tweak in order to respring properly on affected firmwares.

 
## iOS 9.3 Support

Keybags do not unlock on iOS <=9.2.1 but they do on iOS 9.3

The issue we are having with iOS 9.3 currently is that there's a ton of sandbox errors during the boot process.

See [here](https://files.catbox.moe/wn83g9.mp4) for a video example of why we need sandbox patches for iOS 9

Once we have sandbox patched out properly on iOS 9.3, downgrading to it should work properly.

## Quirks

Passcode & TouchID do not work. If the device ever asks you for a passcode, it will normally accept anything as the passcode due to an unfixable issue.

If you lock the screen while the phone is on, it will cause a deep sleep bug which causes the phone to be frozen at a black screen until you force reboot the device. Check the Troubleshooting section for more information.

The App Store is broken on iOS 8 and 9

Encrypted WiFi networks do **not** work when tether downgrading with this tool. This is caused by an issue with SEP. Check the Troubleshooting section for more information

Respringing is currently broken on iOS 7.0.x. In order to respring on those versions you should open the wtfis app on the home screen and hit "go".

In order for tweaks to work on ios 7.1.x, you need to open the wtfis app on the home screen and hit "go". This patches the sandbox, allowing for tweak injection to work correctly.


## Requirements

macOS High Sierra to Catalina. The script only officially supports these versions.

Java 8 https://builds.openlogic.com/downloadJDK/openlogic-openjdk/8u262-b10/openlogic-openjdk-8u262-b10-mac-x64.pkg

Python. You can download it for macOS High Sierra from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-macosx10.6.pkg 

*Note: This should automatically be installed by the script.

pyimg4 just run `pip3 install pyimg4` before running the script. The script should do this automatically too

Intel Mac. Hackintoshes with AMD CPUs will **NOT** work with this.

Stable internet connection. Please don't try using this with dial up...

At least 20GB of free space on your computer

USB Type-A port and Lightning cable. USB Type-C ports will **NOT** work with this script. If you're using a Mac that only has a USB-C port (such as 12" MacBooks, and late Intel MacBook Airs) a dongle/dock with a USB-A port should work just fine with a standard USB-A to Lightning cable.

Working iDevice: The script has to backup `apticket.der`, `sep-firmware.img4`, `Baseband`, and `keybags` from your device before you can downgrade to an older iOS version.
